## 📌 Overview

**OlympicX** is an interactive web-based data analytics platform designed to explore historical Olympic trends across countries, athletes, and sports.

The platform enables dynamic comparisons, visual exploration, and filter-based insights using enhanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques applied to cleaned and structured Olympic datasets.

It transforms raw Olympic records into intuitive visual intelligence.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Analyze Olympic performance trends across time  
- Compare countries, athletes, and sports interactively  
- Identify medal dominance patterns  
- Visualize participation growth and historical shifts  
- Enable dynamic filtering for deeper insight discovery

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Significant data enhancement was performed before visualization:

- Removed missing and inconsistent entries  
- Handled NaN values systematically  
- Corrected categorical inconsistencies (country codes, sports labels)  
- Standardized year and medal formats  
- Validated athlete-country mappings  
- Ensured structured dataset integrity for reliable comparisons  

This ensures analytical accuracy and meaningful visual outputs.
